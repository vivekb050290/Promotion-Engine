# Problem Statement: Promotion Engine

Implement a simple promotion engine for a checkout process. Our Cart contains a list of single character SKU ids (A, B, C.	) over which the promotion engine will need to run.

The promotion engine will need to calculate the total order value after applying the 2 promotion types:|
 - 	buy 'n' items of a SKU for a fixed price (3 A's for 130)
 - 	buy SKU 1 & SKU 2 for a fixed price ( C + D = 30 )

The promotion engine should be modular to allow for more promotion types to be added at a later date (e.g. a future promotion could be x% of a SKU unit price). For this coding exercise you can assume that the promotions will be mutually exclusive; in other words if one is applied the other promotions will not apply

## Test Setup

Unit price for SKU IDs:\
A	50\
B	30\
C	20\
D	15

Active Promotions:\
3 of A's for 130\
2 of B's for 45\
C & D for 30

Scenario A\
1	* A	50\
1	* B	30\
1	* C	20

Total	100

Scenario	B	\
5 * A		130 + 2*50\
5 * B		45 + 45 + 30\
1 * C		28

Total	370

Scenario C\
3	* A	130\
5	* B	45 + 45 + 1 * 30\
1	* C	-\
1	* D	30

Total	280

## Notes

â€¢	The promotion rules are mutually exclusive, that implies only one promotion (individual SKU or combined) is applicable to a particular SKU. Rest depends on the imagination of the programmer for which scenarios they want to consider, for example (case 1 => 2A = 30 and A=A40%) or (case 2 => either 2A = 30 or A=A40%)


# Solution: PromotionEngine

.Net Core 5.0 application, implemented in C#, using Visual Studio 2019.

## Projects

### PromotionEngine

This .net core library contains the business logic, separated into 3 main parts:
 - PromotionRules
 - Cart
 - Store

#### PromotionRules

Applying the **Rule Engine Design Pattern**, the solution supports to implement multiple different PromotionRules which could be added to the rule set and all implement the `IsApplicable` and the `Execute` functions, for the `Cart` as the context to pass data across the rules.

Currently only 2 types are implemented:
 - `CombinedItemFixedPricePromotion`
 - `NitemForFixedPricePromotion`

The `PromotionRuleExtensions` provides functionality to parse a promotion from its text representation to a `PromotionRule` inherited C# object.

#### Cart

A `Cart` is used to store the list of `SKUItem`s and to maintain the `TotalPrice` of the items in the cart. It provides functionality to `AddItem` or `RemoveItem` from the `Cart`.

A `Cart` item wraps an `SKUitem` that was added to the `Cart` and tracks if a promotion was applied to it, and the `FinalPrice` which might differ from its unit price if a promotion was applied to it.

#### Store

The`Store` implements all the core functionalities defined in the `IStore` interface for `SKUitem`, `Cart` and `PromotionRule` CRUD operations.

### PromotionEngineTests

Contains several test classes and test methods, including unit tests and scenario tests.

### PromotionEngineWebApp

Asp.Net Core Web application that uses the IStore functionalities to expose the Store, Cart and Promotion related operations as a REST API.\
It also generates an Open API 3.1 specification and Swagger UI for easier testing.

3 main controllers defined:
 - `PromotionsController`
 - `SKUitemController`
 - `StoreController`

Data is mapped to DTO type from the types defined in the `PromotionEngine` project, wher applicable.
These DTO objects are exposed in the OpenApi schema.

## Demo

The `PromotionEngineWebApp` was added to a Docker Container and pushed to a public AWS ECR and made available on the following URL for testing:
http://ec2-34-203-29-34.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1234/swagger

## Usage

1. Add SKUitems (if needed)
2. Add Promotions, using the syntax of "3 of A's for 130" or C & D for 30 (if needed)
3. Add SKUitems to the cart
4. Get the cart
5. Get total price (before applying the promotions)
6. Checkout (applies the promotions)
7. Get total price (before applying the promotions)

Further CRUD operations supported to SKUitem, Cart, Promotions and Store methods.

## Notes, considerations

1. The core functionality is implemented in the `PromotionEngine` project, the `PromotionEngineWebApp` project is added only for easier testing and demo.
2. The `PromotionEngine` is tested via code tests from `PromotionEngineTests` project, but the test coverage could be further improved.
3. Currently the extension of the available `PromotionRule` types could be added only by adding further implementations. A future imrovement could be to use a Dependency Injection framework (e.g Autofac) that could pick up .dll files that contain an implementation of `PromotionRule` and inject the to the list of promotionrules. Different promotions for the existing `PromotionRule`s could be added with the current implementation. For example another promotion: "4 of C's for 70" or "A & B for 60".
4. The `PromotionEngineWebApp` does not contain code test. For simplicity, the web method's response is `HTTP 400 BadRequest` in every case when an Exception occurs, otherwise `HTTP 200 Ok`. 
5. The Swagger UI is exposed also when not in development mode and it does not contain any AUTH.
6. Currently all the operations are done via the `IStore` dependency in the `PromotionEngineWebApp` and data is stored in memory only. The code could be restructured to store data in a SQL database (e.g. PostgreSQL) to persist data between restarts. For data persistance the EntityFramework could be used.
7. The code does not contain any logging, but NLog could be used for detailed logging.
8. The `PromotionEngine` library is referenced in the`PromotionEngineWebApp` within the VS Solution. Later it could be published as a separate Nuget package and installed through Nuget.
9. Exception handling, input validation and error handling could be further improved accross the code.
